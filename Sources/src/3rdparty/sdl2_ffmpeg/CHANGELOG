Tested the code against miniDart
Commited the changes
Added a new (ffmpeg frame as input ) YUV -> BGR convertion (cv::Mat as output)

Version 0.9 / 2018 october 09

added some comments in simple_opencv.cpp, bcause of cv:resize() too hungry (costing around 10% of power for one core @ 720p)
adapted the pkg-config.pc file to the new repo
modified all the path, to avoid claching with SDL_kitchensink

FFMPEG + OpenCV implementation, using cv::Mat + cv::imshow a cv::namedWindow // WORKS well, but software convertion needs 32% of one core.
FFPMEG + OpenGL texture2D implementation // currently broken
FFMPEG + SDL2 YUV frames -> yuv2rgb conversion using glsl -> OpenCV cv::Mat  //  WIP

Started 2018 August 1st  // To be continued
