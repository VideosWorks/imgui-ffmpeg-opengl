This file contains important information for Linux build ONLY

This is the first version, and of course we'll improve, and do the maximum to make the build easy.

PLEASE file an issue or a PR if you want to help, or inform us about whatever Linux build issue.

Waiting, PLEASE have a look too, at the page : https://framagit.org/ericb/miniDart/tree/master/testing_Linux


A) All dependencies solved

cd miniDart/Sources

cp -r fonts  build
cp -r images build
make

=> if nothing wrong occurs, should provide a binary in build.

cd build
./miniDart 

Enjoy !


B) Dependencies not solved

Dependencies :

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
0. install some archives.

MANDATORY : miniDart won't even launch without a working OpenGL 3+ (3.2+ strongly suggested)

Thus, you'll need to install mesa + DRM (means Direct Rendering Manager) including 3D features, depending on your hardware.

=> READ miniDart_install_log : I did exactly that testing with an Ubuntu distribution. Should be a good start, to install everything.

HELP needed : I'm using Intel hardware, and I didn't test miniDart with NVidia drivers. Please file an issue in case of problem.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
1. ffmpeg 4.x

FYI, with the git version (master), I'm simply using : 

./configure  \
             --enable-shared --enable-pic --enable-opengl
             --enable-libpulse --enable-libmodplug \
             --enable-libgme --enable-libv4l2 --enable-libopenjpeg \
             --enable-vaapi --enable-openssl --enable-libdav1d \
             --enable-libwavpack --enable-libdrm

Mandatory switches :     --enable-shared --enable-pic --enable-opengl
Other can perhaps be optional, up to you.


"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
2. SDL2

Mandatory : version 2.0.9 mini (contains important sound fixes)

Using Linuxmint or Debian, the SDL2 version is prehistoric, and I'm used to replace with a recent one.

My configure comes from the Debian build way, and the command line is : 

./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu --disable-rpath \
            --disable-video-directfb --disable-nas --disable-esd --disable-arts \
            --disable-alsa-shared --disable-pulseaudio-shared --disable-x11-shared

Please adapt and inform us (file an issue) if something goes wrong.


"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
3. Linux kernel 

Simply advised : a recent Linux kernel, like 4.15 is perfect, but 4.x should work (untested with 5.x)



"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
4. OpenCV  3.4.x

Mandatory: OpenCV 3.4.0  (or 3.4.x, but maybe not everything will work)

Important information, including build instruction is provided there :

https://framagit.org/ericb/miniDart/tree/master/testing_Linux

BEFORE to file an issue, PLEASE READ everything carefully.


"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
5. Freetype + Harfbuzz

- harfbuzz 1.4. or +
- freetype 2.8.1 or + is prefered

The best is to build a recent version, but please note that unfortunaly, freetype and harfbuzz have circular dependencies to be solved.

The problem should vanish soon (it's been taken over recently), and the most simple is to trust the version provided by your distribution




FIXME : complete with devs feedback
