This file contains information about the modifications I did in Dear ImGui code (the latest on top offile)

Dear ImGui changes are under MIT License, to keep the backward compatibility, and just in case you are interested with my code.

2020/03/20

Added imgui_custom folder, containing the files I created :

- imgui_themes.cpp
- imgui_themes.h

Both are located in imgui_custom, and imgui_themes.cpp will be compiled if ImGui_version is > 1.72 (see Makefile located in Sources)

2020/03/18 

Current version of miniDart is based on Dear ImGui master + docking branch (based on 1.75 ?)
